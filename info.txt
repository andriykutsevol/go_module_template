https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module

    This is the first part of a tutorial that introduces a few fundamental features of the Go language.

        Start by creating a Go module. 
        In a module, you collect one or more related packages for a discrete and useful set of functions. 

        For example, you might create a module with packages
        that have functions for doing financial analysis 
        so that others writing financial applications can use your work.

        For more about developing modules, see 
        "Developing and publishing modules"

        Go code is grouped into packages, 
        and packages are grouped into modules. 
        Your module specifies dependencies needed to run your code, 
        including the Go version and the set of other modules it requires.

        $ go mod init github.com/andriykutsevol/go_module_template
